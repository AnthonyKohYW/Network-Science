This project attempts to build graphs from edgelist defined in the output CSV file from "xml_parse_journal.py" for analysis. 

- Extract the authors and journals information from the provided input xml file.
- Output an edgelist CSV formatted file to be used by Networkx function calls.
- Use the extracted information to build graphs for visualization (Networkx. matplotlib).
